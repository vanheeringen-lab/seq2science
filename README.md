Seq2science is the attempt of the *van heeringen lab* to generate a collection of generic pipelines/workflows which can be used by complete beginners to bioinformatics and experienced bioinformaticians alike. Please take a look at our [docs](https://vanheeringen-lab.github.io/seq2science/) for help with installation, how to run it, and best practices.
