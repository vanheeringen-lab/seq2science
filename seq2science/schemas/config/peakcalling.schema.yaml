  # peak caller algorithms
  peak_caller:
    type: object
    properties:
      genrich:  {type: string}
      hmmratac: {type: string}
      macs2:    {type: string}
    minProperties: 1   # if you want to have at least one
    additionalProperties: false
    default:
      macs2: --shift -100 --extsize 200 --nomodel --keep-dup 1 --buffer-size 10000

  # keep macs2 mates when peak calling with shift
  macs2_keep_mates:
    description: macs2 normally removes paired-end mates when doing --nomodel shift peak calling. When this flag is on, the paired-end bam is converted to sngle-end bam, so all reads are counted. This is not conventional to do, but might help with low sequencing depth.
    default: false
    type: boolean

  peak_windowsize:
    description: when combining narrowpeaks, how much each summit should be extended by when considering overlapping peaks. A summit is expanded by the windowsize on each side, so the total width is twice the peak_windowsize.
    default: 100
    type: integer

  slop:
    description: how much the summits should be extended by (on each side) for making a peak count table. When for instance a slop of 100 is chosen, the final peak's width is 200.
    default: 100
    type: integer

  logbase:
    description: The log base of the number of reads under peak count tables
    default: 2
    type: number
