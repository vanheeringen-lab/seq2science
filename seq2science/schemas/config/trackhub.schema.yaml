description: seq2science trackhub configuration

properties:
  # scope of analysis: create a trackhub or only align and/or quantify (and create gene counts)
  create_trackhub:
    description: generate a trackhub (and required files)?
    default: true
    type: boolean

  trackhub_dir:
    description: directory where to store the trackhub (defaults inside the result dir)
    default: trackhub
    type: string

  bigwig_dir:
    description: directory where to store the bigwigs used by the trackhub (defaults inside the result dir)
    default: bigwigs
    type: string

  deeptools_bamcoverage:
    description: flags for bam to bigwig conversions with deeptools bamCoverage
    default: '--normalizeUsing BPM --binSize 1'  # Bins Per Million mapped reads, same as TPM in RNA-seq

  force_assembly_hub:
    description: whether an assembly hub should be made even though the assembly is supported by ucsc. Sometimes e.g. chromosomes have different names (chr1 vs 1) which makes the trackhub not display the data properly. Forcing an assembly hub can help in these cases.
    default: false
    type: boolean
