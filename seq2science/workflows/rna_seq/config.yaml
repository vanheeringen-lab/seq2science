# how to handle replicates
technical_replicates: merge    # change to "keep" to not combine them

# which trimmer to use
trimmer: fastp

# which quantifier to use
quantifier: htseq  # or salmon or featurecounts

##### aligner and filter options are not used for the gene counts matrix if the quantifier is Salmon

# which aligner to use
aligner: star

# filtering after alignment
markduplicates: -Xms4G -Xmx6G MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=999  # keep duplicates (check dupRadar in the MultiQC)
