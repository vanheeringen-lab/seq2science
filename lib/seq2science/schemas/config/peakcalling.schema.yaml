description: seq2science peak calling configuration

properties:
  # peak caller algorithms
  peak_caller:
    type: object
    properties:
      genrich:  {type: string}
      hmmratac: {type: string}
      macs2:    {type: string}
    minProperties: 1   # if you want to have at least one
    additionalProperties: false
    default:
      macs2: --shift -100 --extsize 200 --nomodel --keep-dup 1 --buffer-size 10000

  # keep macs2 mates when peak calling with shift
  macs2_keep_mates:
    description: macs2 normally removes paired-end mates when doing --nomodel shift peak calling. When this flag is on, the paired-end bam is converted to sngle-end bam, so all reads are counted. This is not conventional to do, but might help with low sequencing depth.
    default: false
    type: boolean

  peak_windowsize:
    description: when merging narrowpeaks, how much each summit should be extended by (on each side) when considering overlapping peaks. If for instance a peak_windowsize of 100 is chosen, all peaks within 100 bps of each other will be merged.
    default: 100
    type: integer

  slop:
    description: how much each summit is extended by (on both sides) when making the final peak. For e.g. count tables it is important that all peaks are of the same size. If for instance a slop of 100 is chosen, the final peak width (for all peaks) is 200.
    type: integer
    default: 100

  logbase:
    description: The log base of the number of reads under peak count tables
    default: 2
    type: number

  heatmap_slop:
    description: how much the summits should be extended by (on each side) for making a heatmap of peaks in the multiQC report. If for instance a slop of 1000 is chosen, the final peak's width is 2000.
    default: 1000
    type: integer

  heatmap_npeaks:
    description: The number of random peaks used for the heatmap. This at most visualizes all peaks found, so picking a number higher than the number of peaks has no effect. The reason to pick a smaller number is to limit computational resources.
    default: 20000
    type: integer

  deeptools_heatmap_options:
    description: the options passed to deeptools when visualizing the heatmap
    default: --kmeans 6 --xAxisLabel "Summit distance (bp)"
    type: string

  idr_options:
    description: the options passed to idr when combining peaks
    default: ''
    type: string

  run_gimme_maelstrom:
    description: whether or not to run gimme maelstrom on the consensus peakset.
    default: false
    type: boolean

  gimme_maelstrom_database:
    description: which motif database to run gimme maelstrom with.
    default: 'gimme.vertebrate.v5.0'
    type: string

  gimme_maelstrom_params:
    description: the settings with which gimme maelstrom is run.
    default: ''
    type: string

  motif2factors_database_references:
    description: On which assembly(s) the original gimme motif2factors is based. Defaults to human and mouse.
    default:
      - GRCh38.p13
      - GRCm38.p6
    type: array
    items:
      type: string

  motif2factors_reference:
    description: Which assemblies should be taken along for the orthology inference.
    default:
      - danRer11
      - UCB_Xtro_10.0
      - GRCg6a
      - BraLan2
