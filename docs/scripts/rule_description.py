# Per rule explanation

This is an automatically generated list of all supported rules, and their docstrings. At the start of each workflow 
run a list is printed of which rules will be run. And while the workflow is running it prints which rules are being \
started and finished. This page is here to give an explanation to the user about what each rule does, and for \
developers to find what is, and isn't yet supported.
