# All configurable options

This is an automatically generated summary of all configurable options for seq2science. These options are loosely \
grouped around workflows/topics, however they are generally also shared across workflows. So it is possible that  \
tunable configuration settings are not mentioned in their topic. At the start of each seq2science run the complete \
configuration is printed to stdout. You can use that printed configuration as the complete list of tunable \
configuration settings. 

We believe that all our default settings are reasonable, and manual finetuning is generally not required.
