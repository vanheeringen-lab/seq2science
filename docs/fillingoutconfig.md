# Filling out the config.yaml
Every workflow has many configurable options, and can be set in the `config.yaml` file. In each `config.yaml` we highlighted a couple options that we think are relevant for that specific workflow, and set (we think) **reasonable default** values.

When a workflow starts it prints the complete configuration, and (almost) all these values can be added in the `config.yaml` and changed to your liking. You can see the complete set of configurable options [here](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/snakemake-workflows/tree/master/schemas/config).
