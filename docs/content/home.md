# Welcome
Even though most next-generation sequencing analyses require specific and custom tools, they generally share the same design. Seq2science is the attempt of the *van heeringen lab* to generate a collection of generic pipelines/workflows which can be used by complete beginners to bioinformatics and experienced bioinformaticians alike.

Some of seq2science's features:
* **Downloading of fastq** from the NCBI, ENA, and DDBJ databases.
* **Downloading of genomes** through genomepy.
* All our workflows work automatically with **paired-end** and **single-end** data.
* Extensive MultiQC **quality report**.
* **Trackhub** generation for visualization in the UCSC genome browser.
* Wide selection of different tools.
* And many more...
