## Alignment
Aligning samples has never been easier! See our [alignment](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/snakemake-workflows/tree/master/workflows/alignment) workflow.

### Pipeline steps

#### Downloading of sample(s)
Depending on whether the samples you start seq2science with is your own data, public data, or a mix, the pipeline might start with downloading samples. Take a look at the [downloading_fastq](https://vanheeringen-lab.github.io/seq2science/content/workflows/download_fastq.html) workflow for extensive documentation about downloading of public samples. 

#### Automated trimming
The pipeline starts by trimming the reads with either [trim galore!](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) or [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Trim galore and fastp both automatically detect which adapter was used and remove those. In addition they trim the low quality 3' ends of reads, and remove short reads. Which trimmer should be used (and their params) can be set by the key `trimmer` in the config.yaml. 

#### Alignment & Sorting
After trimming the reads are aligned against an assembly. Currently we support *bowtie2*, *bwa*, *bwa-mem2*, *hisat2* and *STAR* as aligners. Choosing which aligner is as easy as setting the *aligner* variable in the `config.yaml`, for example: `aligner: bwa`. Sensible defaults have been set for every aligner, but can be overwritten for either (or both) the indexing and alignment by specifying them in the `config.yaml`:
```
aligner: 
  star:
    index: '--limitGenomeGenerateRAM 55000000000`  # give STAR 55 GB RAM during indexing (default is 31 GB)
    align: '--readFilesCommand gunzip -c'          # unzips fastqs before aligning
```

The pipeline will check if the assembly you specified is present in the *genome_dir*, and otherwise will download it for you through [genomepy](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/genomepy). All these aligners require an index to be formed first for each assembly, but don't worry, the pipeline does this for you. 

The outputted alignment.bam is immediately sorted by either samtools or sambamba (*bam_sorter*) either in *queryname* or *coordinate* (default) order. Take a look at our [Choosing an aligner](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/snakemake-workflows/wiki/3.-Alignment#choosing-an-appropriate-aligner) section for tips which aligner to use.

#### Custom assembly extensions
The genome and/or gene annotation can be extended with custom files, such as ERCC spike-ins for scRNA-seq. To do so, add `custom_genome_extension: path/to/spike_in.fa` and `custom_annotation_extension: path/to/spike_in.gtf` to the config.
Seq2science will place the customized assembly in a separate folder in the `genome_dir`.

#### Mark duplicates
After aligning & sorting the bam duplicate reads are being 'marked' by picard Markduplicates. You can change the call by setting *markduplicates* in config.yaml.

#### Samtools index
Many downstream tools require an index of the deduplicated bam. The pipeline automatically generates these for you.

#### Quality report
It is always a good idea to check the quality of your samples. Along the way different quality control steps are taken, and are outputted in a single [multiqc report](https://multiqc.info/) in the `qc` folder. Make sure to always check the report, and take a look at [interpreting the multiqc report](../results.html#multiqc-quality-report)!

#### Trackhub
A UCSC compatible trackhub can be generated for this workflow. See the [trackhub page](../results.html#trackhub)<!-- @IGNORE PREVIOUS: link --> for more information!

### Filling out the samples.tsv
Before running a workflow you will have to specify which samples you want to run the workflow on. Each workflow starts with a `samples.tsv` as an example, and you should adapt it to your specific needs. As an example, the `samples.tsv` could look something like this:
```
sample    assembly    replicate    descriptive_name
GSM123    GRCh38      heart_1      heart_merged
GSM321    GRCh38      heart_1      heart_merged
GSMabc    GRCh38      heart_2      heart_not_merged
GSMxzy    danRer11    stage_8      stage_8
GSM890    danRer11    stage_9      stage_9
```

#### Sample column
This column is necessary for all workflows, not just the atac-seq workflow. If you use the pipeline on public data this should be the name of the accession (e.g. GSM2837484). If you use the pipeline on local data this should be the *basename* of the file without the *extension(s)*. For instance, `/home/user/myfastqs/sample1.fastq.gz` would be `sample1` (for single-ended data). For paired-ended data `/home/user/myfastqs/sample2_R1.fastq.gz` and `/home/user/myfastqs/sample2_R2.fastq.gz` would be `sample2`.

#### Assembly column
This column is necessary for all workflows, except the *downloading samples* workflow. Here you simply add the name of the assembly you want your samples aligned against and the workflow will download it for you.

#### Descriptive_name column
The descriptive_name column is used for the trackhub and multiqc report. In the trackhub your tracks will be called after the descriptive name, and in the multiqc report there will be a button to rename your samples after this column. The descriptive name can not contain '-' characters, but underscores '_' are allowed.

#### Technical replicates
Technical replicates, or any fastq file you may wish to merge, are set using the `replicate` column in the samples.tsv file. All samples with the same name in the `replicate` column will be concatenated into one file with the replicate name.

Example `samples.tsv` utilizing replicate merging:
```
sample    assembly    replicate
GSM123    GRCh38      heart
GSMabc    GRCh38      heart
GSMxzy    danRer11    stage8
GSM890    danRer11
```
Using this file in the alignment workflow will output *heart.bam*, *stage8.bam* and *GSM890.bam*. The MultiQC will inform you of the trimming steps performed on all samples, and subsequent information of the 'replicate' files (of which only *heart* is merged).

**Note:**
If you are working with multiple assemblies in one workflow, replicate names have to be unique between assemblies (you will receive a warning if names overlap).

Replicate merging is turned on by default. It can be turned off by setting `technical_replicates` in the `config.yaml` to `keep`.

#### Colors column
If you are visualizing your data on the UCSC trackhub you can optionally specify the colors of each track.
To do so, you can add the color by name (google "matplotlib colors" for the options), or RGB values, in the "colors" column. Empty fields are considered black.

#### Final notes
- Make sure that the samples.tsv is a tab separated values file when running the pipeline.
- Feel free to delete or add columns to your liking.

### Filling out the config.yaml
Every workflow has many configurable options, and can be set in the `config.yaml` file. In each `config.yaml` we highlighted a couple options that we think are relevant for that specific workflow, and set (we think) **reasonable default** values.

When a workflow starts it prints the complete configuration, and (almost) all these values can be added in the `config.yaml` and changed to your liking. You can see the complete set of configurable options in the [extensive docs](../schemas.html).

### Best practices
#### BAM mapping quality filtering
All aligners pass a mapping quality (MAPQ) score to the reads. This score reflects the certainty that a read belongs to a certain genomic position. This score can then be used by [deeptools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to only keep reads of which the aligner is certain where it aligns, and to limit multimappers. You can set the minimum mapq score by using the configuration variable `min_mapping_quality`. Unfortunately, most aligners use a different scoring system. This problem has been nicely summarized [here](https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapq-values-are-really-useful-but-their-implementation-is-a-mess/). 

For the default aligners (BWA and STAR), a minimal quality score has been set to select uniquely mapped reads only. For other aligners, we suggest the following scores to filter for uniquely mapped reads:

|Aligner|min. MAPQ scores for uniquely mapped reads|
|---|---|
|Bowtie2|41|
|Bwa-mem(2)|30|
|Hisat2|44|
|Minimap|0, but use `--secondary=no` as alignment option|
|STAR|255|

#### Cram support
For the edge-case where you want to work with cram files instead of bams, there is an option `cram_no_bam` which will convert your bam files to cram (saves around 60% storage).
